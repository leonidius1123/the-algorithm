As a user, I'd like to easily access all the posts from creators I'm subscribed to. Currently, I have to navigate to each creator's page to view their posts. 
It would be more convenient if these posts were displayed in the "For You" tab.

Let's imagine this scenario: I have a favorite author who has four books available in the bookstore. Two of these books are bestsellers and prominently displayed on the main shelf. 
The other two books, while still interesting, are not as popular and are placed on the author's shelf in alphabetical order. It takes extra effort to find these less popular books.

As a user, I'd be willing to pay $2 a month to have all new books from this author displayed on the main shelf, making them easier to access.
